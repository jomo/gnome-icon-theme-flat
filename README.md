# Gnome Icon Theme Flat

This is a fork of [GNOME Symbolic Icons](https://github.com/GNOME/gnome-icon-theme-symbolic).  
The original icons look flat, nice, and clean â€“ but they are only used "for specific purposes".

This fork uses these icons globally.

# Installation

## Easy way

0. Get latest [release](https://github.com/jomo/gnome-icon-theme-flat/releases)
0. Extract `gnome-flat.tar.gz` into `/usr/share/icons/`

## Custom way

0. `sudo ln -s /path/to/gnome-icon-theme-flat/gnome-flat /usr/share/icons/gnome-flat`
0. Add / Edit icon(s) in `gnome-flat/scalable` as you like
0. Run `scale.sh` from the project's root
  * This will generate different fixed-size PNG files
  * Existing files are skipped
0. Get yourself a coffee, this is gonna take a while!

# Note

These icons are intended for small scale. They don't have a lot of details and use thick strokes. If you scale them up, they're gonne look a bit chunky.

Still better than the bulky multicolored 1990-style gnome icons!

# Original authors

I just renamed some files, all the artwork was done by the [GNOME Project](https://gnome.org)!
