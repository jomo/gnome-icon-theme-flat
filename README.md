# Gnome Icon Theme Flat

This is a fork of [GNOME Symbolic Icons](https://github.com/GNOME/gnome-icon-theme-symbolic).
The original icons look flat, nice, and clean â€“ but they are only used "for specific purposes".

This fork uses these icons globally.

# Original authors

I just renamed some files, all the artwork was done by the [GNOME Project](https://gnome.org)!
